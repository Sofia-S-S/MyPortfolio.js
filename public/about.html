        <p>
          I was born in a West Siberian town named Tomsk (Central-South Russia).
          I’m youngest of two children and my older sister has always been a top
          student of her class and a good example for me to be an “A” student.
        </p>
        <p>
          In middle school I fall in love with Mathematics and went to Advanced
          Math High School after. Then I went to Tomsk Institute of Business for
          Finance and Accounting. One year before graduation I applied for an
          entry level accounting position and got a job that allowed me to start
          my professional career. A year later I graduated as a student of honor
          with Special Degree in accounting (an equivalent of Master Degree in
          USA) and moved to Saint-Petersburg (second biggest city in Russia
          after Moscow) to pursue my career. Thank to my education and previous
          experience I got hired by a big architectural company
        </p>

        <p>
          Few years after my career had begin, I won a lottery for green card
          and decided to become a United States resident. I took ESL (English as
          a second language) classes at Wilbur Wright College all the way from
          Beginner to Advanced Level then English 101 and 102. Almost five years
          since I accepted a challenge to change the country, I decided that I’m
          ready to build a new career and enrolled to Coding Booth camp at
          Northwestern University of Chicago.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the end of March of this year I will become a certified Web
          Developer and I believe that knowledge and practical experience I got
          in this program will make me qualified for entry level front and back
          end web developer position.
